# Digits DAO: Front End

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Digits DAO Frontend is based on Astro, a Static Site Generator with Partial Hydration.

#### Landing Page

The landing page is a fully static implementation, meaning the first page load is as fast as possible for a website.

#### App Page

The App Page is an "Astro Island" (or Partial Hydration) page, using `SolidJS` and `WAGMI Core` for all of the ETH logic. The wallet used is `web3modal`.

This was the best all around approach due to the fine-grained reactivity that `SolidJS` offers.

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
